She first made a splash with her debut one-woman show Corinne Fisher: I STALK YOU (Dir. David Crabb) which had a run at The Peoples Improv Theater (The PIT) in the Summer of 2010 and was featured in Time Out New York. Since then, she has been a regular on the stand-up scene playing anything from dive bars to world-famous comedy clubs like New York Comedy Club, The Stand, The Standing Room, Caroline’s, Upright Citizens Brigade Theatre, Broadway Comedy Club, Comix, Laugh Boston, The Stress Factory & Gotham. Her second stage show, Almost Former Reality TV Stars, had a run at The PIT in June 2011 and told the true (albeit slightly exaggerated) story of how CORINNE and her real-life best friend, actor/model THOMAS WHITFIELD, were hired, then fired from their very own reality TV show.\n\nKnown as @PhilanthropyGal on Twitter (slightly tongue-in-cheek…), in 2012 CORINNE performed in a series of benefit shows for the AFGHAN WOMEN’S WRITING PROJECT alongside other female New York comedians including SNL alum RACHEL DRATCH. Over the past few years, CORINNE has been selected to perform in the prestigious BOSTON COMEDY FESTIVAL, the WOMEN IN COMEDY FESTIVAL, THE LAUGHING DEVIL COMEDY FESTIVAL & the SHE-DEVIL FESTIVAL. On YouTube, she is the messed up mind behind Internet vlogger GINA SPRINKLES and the voice of ‘TOIBA’ on the cartoon web series MYSTERY SQUAD GALS, the brainchild of RYAN DUFF.\n\nPerhaps most notably, however, CORINNE is 1/2 of SORRY ABOUT LAST NIGHT…, her comedy writing and performance duo with KRYSTYNA HUTCHINSON. In December 2013, the duo launched Guys We Fucked: The Anti Slut-Shaming Podcast that now boasts a million+ listeners worldwide. Having featured celebs such as AMBER ROSE, STOYA, DAN SAVAGE, JIM NORTON, ARTIE LANGE, HORATIO SANZ, ANDY DICK, LIZZ WINSTEAD (Co-Creator of “The Daily Show”) and JENNI ‘JWOWW’ FARLEY (“Jersey Shore”) in addition to real gents they’ve had their way with, the podcast is consistently ranked among the Top 5 comedy podcasts on iTunes (but has reached as high as #1) and has been featured on The Huffington Post, The Daily Beast, Splitsider, Mother Jones, Perez Hilton, Elle, A.V. Club, E! Online, People, US Magazine, and Bust as well as OPIE & JIM on Sirius Radio and NBC’s LAST CALL WITH CARSON DALY. Previously, the duo wrote and starred in a self-titled sketch show that debuted at the Upright Citizens Brigade Theatre in NYC in the Spring of 2013 (Dir. Jon Bershad) and co-hosted a popular underground comedy variety show of the same name that has had homes at the Brooklyn Winery, The PIT and originated at Gotham City Improv. The show was like the best college keg party you’ve ever been to and featured comedy faves such as HANNIBAL BURESS & KURT METZGER as well as cult folk-rock sensation DAN BERN.\n\nThis Summer, CORINNE and KRYSTYNA will be appearing for the second time at Montreal's JUST FOR LAUGHS FESTIVAL, arguably the most important comedy festival in the world. Last year, their first show sold out so quickly a second had to be added. They have also sold out the main room at The World Famous Comedy Store in Hollywood where they were joined by special guests DANE COOK, NEAL BRENNAN & OWEN BENJAMIN. Additionally, they were also guest editors for GLAMOUR MAGAZINE where they penned their own take on the all-too-familiar “How To Please Your Man” article. The duo's first book, \"FUCKED: Being Sexually Explorative and Self-Confident in a World That's Screwed\" drops on October 24th, 2017. \n\nIn 2014, CORINNE made her television stand-up debut on FOX’s LAUGHS on the special “Under 30” episode. She also co-hosts a monthly show at NEW YORK COMEDY CLUB called NACHO BITCHES with BLAIR SOCCI (MTV’s “Ladylike”) where GARY GULMAN, YANNIS PAPPAS, ARI SHAFFIR, BONNIE MCFARLANE, KEVIN MEANEY, and SNL’s PETE DAVIDSON are regular drop-ins. In the Summer of 2015, FISHER and fellow comic KATIE HANNIGAN created THE COMEDIENNE PROJECT (Dir. TED ALEXANDRO), a show challenging its participants to write and perform twenty new minutes of stand-up sans sex, dating, or relationship material, which was accepted into The NYC Fringe Festival and is now a monthly show at The Standing Room.\n\nCORINNE holds a BFA in Film & Video from the School of Visual Arts, has been trained in the Stanislavski method by Joie Lee (“Do The Right Thing”) and is a graduate of the Upright Citizens Brigade Theatre’s prestigious improvisation training program. She loves ice cream and the Spice Girls."},{"name":"Rell Battle","imgLg":"https://www.grislypearstandup.com/img/imagetest/rell-battle-aef509fd-main-image.jpg?1499720494","imgSm":"https://www.grislypearstandup.com/img/imagetest/rell-battle-aef509fd-thumb-image.jpg?1499720495","bio":"Currently seen on CBS's hit comedy, \"Superior Donuts,\" Rell Battle is a Washington D.C. native who made his stand up comedy television debut on  Adam Devine’s “Houseparty\" on Comedy Central.

Ben was born in a country that no longer exists, the USSR, and in a city that has since changed its name, Leningrad.  Ben could no longer tolerate the Russian winters, so he convinced his parents to emigrate from Russia, to another frozen tundra, untouched by human kindness, Connecticut.  Like many American children, Ben’s best friend and babysitter was the television.  Ben attended Rutgers University, where he co-founded Slutgers.com, a parody of the university’s website, for which he wrote humorous articles and created branded merchandise.  Ben graduated with a double major in Philosophy and Economics, so he knows how to make money, he just doesn’t see the point.  After college, Ben began his corporate career as a Fortune 500 management consultant while moonlighting as a stand up comic.  He can’t explain his day job, but he was worth every penny.  After three years at Accenture, Ben entered a fully-funded PhD program in Neuroeconomics at California Technical Institute (CalTech), a school which boasts 31 Nobel laureates and 0 HBO Comedy Specials.  However, he quit grad school to dedicate full time to stand up comedy.  Ben’s family thinks that was his best joke ever.  Soon after quitting, Ben created the motivational seminar and e-book, How to Find Your Passion, which guides high school and college students towards their future career path.  Ben has appeared on FOX’s Laughs, CBS This Morning, National Geographic’sBrain Games, FOX’s The Wendy Williams Show, TruTV’s All Worked Up, The Weather Channel, Rooftop Comedy and been featured as TimeOut New York’s Joke of the Week.  He has twice headlined at Caroline’s on Broadway, hosted at the Lincoln Center and performs nightly in New York City.  Ben has performed in Caroline’s “March Madness” contest, The Laugh Your Asheville Off Comedy Festival, The World Series of Comedy, The Laughing Devil Festival, The Devil Cup and the Ventura Comedy Festival.  He has performed all across the country including Los Angeles, San Francisco, Miami, Philadelphia, Washington, DC and even New Jersey.  Ben’s first comedy album, Neuro Comedy, is available oniTunes and Pandora.  Ben regularly records on-air comedy sketches for various radio stations across the country.  His short film and sketch work has been featured in the 48 Hour Film Festival, The Williamsburg Film Festival, The Sparrow Film Festival and on the comedy website The Interrobang.  He writes, directs and edits short films and video sketches, found on BigBenComedy.com.  Ben is also the creator of the illustrated coffee table book, Russian Optimism: Dark Nursery Rhymes To Cheer You Right Up, an Amazon Top 5 Best Seller in Humor.  Russian Optimism contains thirty of Russia’s most horrifically hysterical nursery rhymes, in English.  Each rhyme is 2-4 lines, with an innocent title and a horrible ending.  Each rhyme is accompanied by a brightly colored yet twisted illustration of the scenario described to add humor. For example, The Woods: “A little boy found a machine gun. Nothing lives in the woods anymore.”  Russian Optimism has been mentioned on Inc.,  BoingBoing, Elite Daily, Marginal Revolution, The Interrobang,  Stage Time Magazine,  Fan Girl Nation, The Family Farce, Publisher’s Weekly, The Political Carnival and The NY Post."},{"name":"Charles McBee","imgLg":"https://www.grislypearstandup.com/img/imagetest/charles-mcbee-c54d0aaa-main-image.jpg?1479710242","imgSm":"https://www.grislypearstandup.com/img/imagetest/charles-mcbee-c54d0aaa-thumb-image.jpg?1479710242","bio":"In 2014, Charles McBee made national stand-up comedy appearances on Gotham Comedy Live on AXS TV and Laughs on FOX. He also starred in the critically acclaimed Off Broadway Production, “HA!… The Musical, from Emmy award winning writer, Michelle Wendt.
